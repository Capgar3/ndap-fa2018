For late policy please see [the syllabus](https://github.com/alexhuth/ndap-fa2018/blob/master/README.md#late-homework--extension-policy). Partial credit will be awarded for partially correct solutions. Three of the seven problems include bonus exercises worth 1 point each, so the maximum score on this problem set is 63/60.\n",
